# Flickr-Web-Scraper

Accepts user input to determine a search request and number of images you would like to download.

Scraper goes to Flickr.com, searches for your request and downloads a specified number of images
based on the integer provided.

Downloads are set to a local folder on my hdd as this is a personal project.
